MoE Stability Callback
======================
Monitors whether the MoE router is staying healthy over the course of training.
A healthy router distributes tokens reasonably evenly, keeps all experts alive,
and remains uncertain enough (high entropy) that it is still learning to route.

Three metrics are tracked per layer, per tower (und / gen):

  Dead Expert Rate
  ----------------
  Fraction of experts receiving fewer than 10% of their fair-share of tokens
  (i.e. load fraction f_i < 0.1 / N). A dead expert has been effectively shut
  out by the router — it gets no gradient signal and its capacity is wasted.
  Ideal = 0. A rising dead-expert rate in the gen tower during early training
  is a common failure mode.

  Load Imbalance Factor (LIF)
  ---------------------------
  N * max(f_i), where f_i is the fraction of tokens routed to expert i.
  Measures how much the busiest expert is overloaded relative to uniform.
  LIF = 1.0 is perfect balance; <= 1.3 is healthy; > 3.0 indicates severe
  collapse onto a small set of experts. This is the same quantity watched by
  the load-balancing loss, but measured empirically rather than from the loss
  objective.

  Router Entropy (normalized)
  ---------------------------
  Mean per-token Shannon entropy of the full routing distribution, divided by
  log(N) to put it on a [0, 1] scale. H = 1 means the router is maximally
  uncertain (uniform over all experts); H = 0 means it always picks the same
  expert. Early in training entropy is high; we want it to stay reasonably
  high (> ~0.7) so the router continues to explore. A sudden drop signals
  routing collapse.

Buffer ownership
----------------
  This callback is fully self-contained: it reads and resets its own dedicated
  buffers (stability_tokens_per_expert, stability_total_tokens, sum_token_entropy).
  It does not depend on ExpertHeatmap's reset cycle.

    What it captures
    ----------------
    Whether the MoE router remains in a healthy, balanced state over training.
    The three metrics collectively answer: are all experts still being used
    (dead_expert_rate), is load spread evenly (lif), and is the router still
    making uncertain, exploratory decisions (router_entropy_normalized)?

    W&B layout
    ----------
    For each metric and each tower, two kinds of series are logged:
      - moe_stability/<metric>/<tower>/layer_NNN  — per model layer time series
      - moe_stability/<metric>/<tower>/mean|max   — summary across all MoE layers

    Typical healthy ranges:
      dead_expert_rate  → 0 (any sustained non-zero value is a concern)
      lif               → <= 1.3 (alarm at > 3.0)
      router_entropy_normalized → > 0.7 (collapse if it drops sharply)
