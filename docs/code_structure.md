`cosmos/` is the entry point for training. `cosmos-inference/` is kept in-tree as a synced subtree containing the inference-side packages, served as a reference and for end-to-end checkpoint export workflows; it is not a build dependency of `cosmos/`.

## The `cosmos/` Package

The `cosmos/` package is organized around the workflow of a large-scale, distributed training run — particularly post-training and reinforcement-learning regimes — with each subpackage owning one concern.

```

### `cosmos/algorithm/`

Algorithmic primitives that are independent of the model and trainer.

- `loss/` — supervised and distillation losses (cross-entropy, flow-matching, KL, etc.).
- `reward/` — reward functions and learned reward heads.
- `rl/` — RL update rules (PPO, GRPO, DPO-family) that consume losses and rewards.

Add new objectives here, not inside the trainer.

### `cosmos/callbacks/`

Pluggable lifecycle hooks invoked by the trainer at well-defined points (step begin/end, epoch boundary, eval, save, exception). Use callbacks for cross-cutting concerns such as wandb/W&B logging, gradient clipping, MoE stability monitoring, dataloader-state checkpointing, and learning-rate logging.

### `cosmos/checkpoint/`

All checkpoint I/O lives here:

- DCP (PyTorch Distributed Checkpoint) save/load
- HuggingFace `safetensors` import/export
- Schema migration and resume-from-step logic

See also `docs/checkpoints.md`.

### `cosmos/communicator/`

Communication primitives between processes — point-to-point send/recv, broadcast helpers, and any RPC-style channels used between the controller and workers. Keep raw `torch.distributed` / NCCL calls out of business logic; route them through this layer.

### `cosmos/controller/`

The orchestrator for a multi-worker job. The controller drives the training loop, hands batches to rollout/reward workers, collects gradients, and decides when to checkpoint or evaluate. Think "head node logic" — there is one controller per job.

### `cosmos/data/`

Datasets, samplers, collators, augmentations, and data-side parallelism (e.g. sequence packing, multi-aspect batching). New dataset formats and new augmentations both live here. See `docs/dataset.md`.

### `cosmos/evaluation/`

Evaluation harnesses run against trained checkpoints — metrics, dataset-driven eval loops, and reporting. Distinct from `inference/`: evaluation is offline and metric-oriented.

### `cosmos/inference/`

Inference utilities used **during training** (e.g. rollout generation, validation-time sampling). Production inference engines live in `cosmos-inference/` and are not pulled in here.

### `cosmos/launcher/`

Job launching back-ends: Slurm, `torchrun`, and Kubernetes adapters. Selects the launch path based on the environment and forwards process rank/world-size to the controller.

### `cosmos/model/`

Model architectures and the parallelism wrappers around them (FSDP, tensor parallel, context parallel, pipeline parallel). The trainer is model-agnostic; everything the trainer touches goes through this layer.

### `cosmos/tools/`

CLI entry points surfaced from the package (as opposed to standalone scripts in the top-level `tools/`). Use this for utilities that need to import `cosmos.*` internals.

### `cosmos/trainer/`

The training loop itself — gradient accumulation, optimizer step, scheduler step, mixed-precision policy, and the dispatcher that fires callbacks. Stays narrow on purpose: model details live in `model/`, algorithm details in `algorithm/`.

### `cosmos/utils/`

Shared low-level helpers (logging, config loading, distributed setup, profiling). Keep this folder *thin* — anything substantial should grow into its own subpackage.

### `cosmos/workers/`

Specialized worker roles for distributed RL jobs. Each worker is a long-running process the controller talks to:

- `reference/` — frozen reference policy (for KL anchoring in PPO/GRPO/DPO).
- `reward/` — reward-model worker; computes scalar rewards for rollouts.
- `rollout/` — on-policy generation worker; samples trajectories from the current policy.
- `simulations/` — simulator-backed environment worker (used when reward comes from a sim rather than a learned model).

Add new worker types as sibling subpackages — each owns its own startup, message loop, and shutdown.

## Supporting Directories

- `tests/` — pytest tests, mirroring the `cosmos/` package layout.
- `examples/` — runnable end-to-end examples; see `examples/README.md`.
- `docker/` — Dockerfiles and image build helpers; see `docker/README.md`.
- `tools/` (repo root) — standalone CLI utilities not requiring `cosmos.*` imports; see `tools/README.md`.
- `cosmos-inference/` — synced subtree of the inference-side codebase, used for checkpoint export and reference integrations.
