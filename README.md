# Cosmos

**Cosmos** is an end-to-end framework for training and serving world foundation models. It is organized as two tightly-integrated halves:

- **Training infrastructure** — the `cosmos/` package and the documentation in [`docs/`](./docs), covering setup, dataset preparation, distributed training, checkpointing, evaluation, and configuration.
- **Inference infrastructure** — the [`cosmos-inference/`](./cosmos-inference) subtree, containing the Diffusers / Transformers / vLLM integrations and end-to-end inference pipelines.

Both halves share the same dependency manifest at the repository root, so a single `uv sync` installs everything needed to train a model and serve its checkpoints.

- [Quickstart](#setup)
- [Training](#training)
- [Inference](#inference)

## Overview

The training side provides:

- A distributed trainer with FSDP / tensor / context / pipeline parallelism (see [`cosmos/trainer/`](./cosmos/trainer) and [`cosmos/model/`](./cosmos/model)).
- A worker-based RL / post-training topology with `controller`, `rollout`, `reward`, `reference`, and `simulations` workers (see [`cosmos/workers/`](./cosmos/workers)).
- A pluggable algorithm layer for losses, reward models, and RL update rules (see [`cosmos/algorithm/`](./cosmos/algorithm)).
- Native DCP checkpointing with HuggingFace `safetensors` import/export.
- Dataset abstractions for JSONL, WebDataset, and LeRobot formats.

The inference side under [`cosmos-inference/`](./cosmos-inference) exposes ready-to-use pipelines for offline batch generation and online serving (Ray, Gradio), with backends for HuggingFace Transformers, vLLM, and Diffusers.

## Setup

For full instructions and alternative installation methods, see [Setup](./docs/setup.md).

Before installing, make sure your machine meets the [System Requirements](./docs/setup.md#system-requirements). If you want a curated PyTorch + CUDA environment, start from the [recommended base image](./docs/setup.md#recommended-base-image).

Install system dependencies:

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ffmpeg libx11-dev tree wget
```

Install the package with `uv`:

```shell
uv sync --all-extras --group=cu130-train
source .venv/bin/activate && export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=
```

If you are starting from the [recommended NVIDIA NGC base image](./docs/setup.md#recommended-base-image) (`nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.09-py3`), a one-shot quickstart is documented [here](./docs/setup.md#quickstart-from-the-recommended-base-image).

## Training

The training infrastructure lives in [`cosmos/`](./cosmos), with user-facing documentation in [`docs/`](./docs):

A minimal single-GPU training launch looks like:

```shell
python -m cosmos.scripts.train --config <experiment-config>
```

See [Training](./docs/training.md) for multi-GPU / multi-node launches and the full set of CLI arguments.

## Inference

End-to-end inference — offline batch generation, online serving with Ray and Gradio, and integration with HuggingFace Transformers, vLLM, and Diffusers — is documented in [`cosmos-inference/README.md`](./cosmos-inference/README.md).

Once a checkpoint has been trained in this repo, export it (see [Checkpoints](./docs/checkpoints.md)) and follow the inference README for serving.
