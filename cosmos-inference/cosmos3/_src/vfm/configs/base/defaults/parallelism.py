"""Shared user-facing parallelism schema for VFM and VLM.

Both project trees (vfm/, vfm/configs/base/vlm/) instantiate the same
ParallelDims runtime at vfm/utils/parallelism.py. They now also share this
single user-facing config schema. Trainer-side translation from the long
descriptive field names here to the short ParallelDims constructor kwargs
happens at the read site (see vfm/models/{omni_mot_model,vlm_model}.py).
